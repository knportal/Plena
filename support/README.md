## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What devices does Plena support?**
A: Plena requires iOS 17.0+ on iPhone and watchOS 10.0+ on Apple Watch (Series 4 or newer recommended for full sensor support).

**Q: Do I need an Apple Watch to use Plena?**
A: While an Apple Watch provides the best experience with real-time sensor data, you can use Plena on iPhone alone. However, sensor data collection requires an Apple Watch.

**Q: Does Plena work in the simulator?**
A: No, HealthKit requires a physical device. The app will not function properly in the iOS simulator.

**Q: Is my health data secure?**
A: Yes. All health data is stored locally on your device or in your personal iCloud account. We do not transmit your health data to our servers. See our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for details.

### HealthKit & Permissions

**Q: Why does Plena need HealthKit permissions?**
A: Plena uses HealthKit to read biometric data (heart rate, HRV, respiratory rate) and write meditation session data. HealthKit is Apple's secure framework for health data.

**Q: Can I revoke permissions later?**
A: Yes, you can manage permissions anytime in Settings → Privacy & Security → Health → Plena. You can turn individual data types on or off.

**Q: What happens if I deny permissions?**
A: The app will have limited functionality. You won't be able to start meditation sessions or view sensor data. You can grant permissions later in Settings.

**Q: Does Plena share my health data?**
A: No. We do not share, sell, or transmit your health data to third parties. Your data stays on your device or in your iCloud account.

### Apple Watch

**Q: Which Apple Watch models are supported?**
A: Plena works with Apple Watch Series 4 or newer running watchOS 10.0+. Different models support different sensors:
- Heart Rate: All models (Series 1+)
- HRV: Series 4+
- Respiratory Rate: Series 6+
- Temperature: Series 8/Ultra+
- See [Compatibility Guide](APPLE_WATCH_COMPATIBILITY.md) for details.

**Q: Why don't I see HRV data?**
A: HRV requires Apple Watch Series 4 or later and sufficient session duration (typically 10+ minutes with at least 3 HRV samples).

**Q: Can I start sessions from my Watch?**
A: Yes! The Watch app allows you to start and stop meditation sessions directly from your wrist. Data automatically syncs to your iPhone.

### Data & Sync

**Q: How does data sync between iPhone and Watch?**
A: Data syncs automatically using CloudKit/iCloud when both devices are connected and signed into the same iCloud account.

**Q: Can I export my data?**
A: Your health data is accessible in the Health app on iPhone. You can view and export data from there. Session summaries are stored locally in the app.

**Q: What happens if I delete the app?**
A: Deleting the app removes local app data. Your HealthKit data remains in the Health app. iCloud data may remain depending on your iCloud settings.

**Q: How long is my data stored?**
A: Local app data is stored until you delete the app. HealthKit data follows your Health app settings. iCloud data follows your iCloud storage settings.

### Features

**Q: What sensors does Plena track?**
A: Plena tracks:
- Heart Rate (BPM) - Real-time heart rate monitoring
- Heart Rate Variability / SDNN (ms) - Variation between heartbeats
- Respiratory Rate (breaths/min) - Breathing rate tracking
- Body Temperature - Temperature monitoring during sessions
- VO₂ Max - Maximum oxygen consumption (periodic readings)

All sensors are tracked in real-time during meditation sessions and stored for historical analysis.

**Q: What are stress zones?**
A: Stress zones classify your physiological state:
- 🔵 Calm: Relaxed, low stress
- 🟢 Optimal: Balanced state
- 🟠 Elevated Stress: Higher stress response

**Q: Can I view historical data?**
A: Yes! The Data tab shows historical visualizations with time range options (Day, Week, Month, Year). You can switch between Consistency view (zone distribution) and Trend view (value over time) for each sensor. The view also provides trend statistics and insights.

**Q: What is the Readiness Score?**
A: The Readiness Score is a daily score (0-100) that provides a holistic view of your recovery and readiness. It's calculated from multiple contributors including Resting Heart Rate, HRV Balance, Body Temperature, Recovery Index, and Sleep metrics (duration, balance, regularity). The score helps you understand when you're ready for optimal performance and when to focus on recovery.
