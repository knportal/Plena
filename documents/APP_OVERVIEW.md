# Plena App Overview

## What is Plena?

**Plena** is a meditation tracking application for iPhone and Apple Watch that monitors your biometric data in real time during meditation sessions. By tracking heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate, and other vital signs, Plena helps you understand how your body responds to meditation and track your progress over time.

## 🔺 The Meaning of the Plena Triangle

The three connected points inside the Plena icon represent the three core rhythms of human calm:

**Mind — Breath — Body**

Or scientifically:

**Heart Rate → HRV → Respiration**

These three systems form a loop:

- **Heart rate** reflects moment-to-moment activity
- **HRV** shows adaptability and stress balance
- **Breath** regulates the entire system

When they work in harmony, the triangle becomes balanced — stable, coherent, and calm. That's exactly what Plena measures in real time.
