## Brand Story

### The Triangle: Mind, Breath, Body

The triangle symbolizes the interconnected rhythms that shape human wellbeing. Each node represents one of the body's core signals — heart rate, HRV, and breath — working together to create balance. Plena visualizes these rhythms, helping you understand and improve your inner state with every session.

### Extended Brand Story Version

The three connected points inside the Plena icon represent the three core rhythms of human calm:

**Mind — Breath — Body**

Or scientifically:

**Heart Rate → HRV → Respiration**

These three systems form a loop:

- **Heart rate** reflects moment-to-moment activity
- **HRV** shows adaptability and stress balance
- **Breath** regulates the entire system

When they work in harmony, the triangle becomes balanced — stable, coherent, and calm. That's exactly what Plena measures in real time.

This meaning fits mindfulness, fits biometrics, fits science, fits our visual style, and gives the logo a purpose beyond aesthetics. It's intentional, elevated, and meaningful.
