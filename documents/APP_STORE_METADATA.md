Plena: mindfulness tracking with Real-Time Biometrics

Transform your mindfulness practice with real-time biometric data. Plena tracks your heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate, and more during mindfulness sessions, giving you objective insights into how mindfulness affects your body and mind.

The Triangle: Mind, Breath, Body

The triangle in our icon represents the three core rhythms of human calm:

- Heart Rate reflects moment-to-moment activity
- HRV shows adaptability and stress balance
- Breath regulates the entire system

When these three systems work in harmony, they create balance - stable, coherent, and calm. That's exactly what Plena measures in real time.

Real-Time Stress Zone Classification

See instant feedback during your sessions with color-coded stress zones:

- Calm Zone - Relaxed, low-stress state
- Optimal Zone - Balanced, functioning well
- Elevated Stress Zone - Higher stress response

These zones help you understand your current state and track improvements over time.
