## Important Notes

### Health Data Disclosure Requirements
- Health data collected through HealthKit **must** be disclosed
- Even if data is only used for app functionality, it must be declared
- Health data is always considered "linked to user"

### Optional Disclosure Criteria
Health data does **NOT** meet optional disclosure criteria because:
- It is part of the app's primary functionality (not infrequent/optional)
- It is collected on an ongoing basis (not just during initial setup)
- It is used for core app features

### Data Collection Definition
According to Apple, "collect" means:
> "Transmitting data off the device in a way that allows you and/or your third-party partners to access it for a period longer than what is necessary to service the transmitted request in real time."

**Plena's Status:**
- Health data is read from HealthKit (on-device)
- Session data is stored locally (on-device)
- No data is transmitted off-device to Plena's servers
- iCloud sync (if enabled) is managed by Apple, not Plena

**However:** Since HealthKit data is accessed by the app and stored locally in CoreData, it is considered "collected" for disclosure purposes, even though it's not transmitted to external servers.

---

## Compliance Checklist

- ✅ All HealthKit data types are identified
- ✅ All data purposes are correctly categorized
- ✅ Data linking status is accurate
- ✅ Tracking status is correctly set to "No"
- ✅ Third-party sharing is correctly set to "No"
- ✅ Privacy policy URL is provided

## Future Considerations

If you plan to add any of the following in the future, you'll need to update your privacy disclosure:

- Analytics services (Firebase Analytics, etc.)
- Crash reporting (Crashlytics, etc.)
- User accounts or authentication
- Cloud storage on your own servers
- Advertising or marketing services
- Social media integration
- In-app purchases tracking

**Remember:** You must update your privacy disclosure in App Store Connect whenever your data collection practices change, even if you don't submit an app update.
