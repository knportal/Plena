# App Store Name Options for "Plena"

## Issue

The App Store name "Plena" is already taken by another developer.

## Important Notes

- **Your bundle identifier is:** `com.plena.meditation.app` (unchanged)
- **Device display name:** Users will still see "Plena" on their devices (set in Info.plist)
- **App Store name:** Only affects the App Store listing page

## Recommended Alternative Names

### Option 1: Add descriptive subtitle

- **"Plena Meditation"** ⭐ (Recommended - clear and simple)
- **"Plena: Meditation Tracking"**
- **"Plena — Mind & Body"**

### Option 2: Add modifier to differentiate

- **"Plena Wellness"**
- **"Plena Biofeedback"**
- **"Plena Meditation Tracker"**

### Option 3: Include brand/company name

- **"Plena by Plenitudo"**
- **"Plenitudo Plena"**

## How to Update

### 1. In App Store Connect

- Go to **App Information** → **Name**
- Enter your chosen alternative name
- Save changes

### 2. No code changes needed

- Your bundle identifier stays the same
- Device display name stays "Plena"
- Only the App Store listing name changes

## Next Steps

1. Choose an alternative name from above
2. Try creating the app record again with the new name
3. If you have trademark rights, you can still pursue Option 2 below

## Trademark Claim Process (Optional)

If you have registered trademark rights to "Plena":

1. Go to App Store Connect
2. Find the "Name Conflict" or "Trademark Claim" option
3. Submit:
   - Trademark registration number
   - Proof of ownership
   - Supporting documentation
4. Wait for Apple's review (can take weeks)

## Recommendation

**Use "Plena Meditation"** — it's clear, professional, and doesn't change your brand identity significantly.
