This project uses Swift, SwiftUI, and modern Apple frameworks.

Follow these conventions:

- Use SwiftUI-first design with MVVM structure.
- Networking must use async/await with proper error propagation.
- All model structs must be Codable unless noted otherwise.
- Use dependency injection for testable components.
- All new ViewModels must include:
  • init with dependencies
  • @Published state
  • async load() pattern when applicable
- Avoid force unwraps and force tries.
- Conform to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
- Add unit tests for:
  • Networking calls
  • State transitions
  • Validation logic
