# SwiftData Troubleshooting - Critical Issue

## Problem
Even a minimal SwiftData model fails with `loadIssueModelContainer` error on device.

## Diagnosis
- ✅ Simple model (TestModel) created
- ✅ Model added to targets
- ❌ Even minimal model fails to create ModelContainer
- ❌ Error occurs even with in-memory storage

## Possible Causes

### 1. iOS Version Issue
- **Check**: Device must be running iOS 17.0 or later
- **Verify**: Settings → General → About → Software Version
- **Fix**: Update device to iOS 17.0+ if needed

### 2. Xcode Version Issue
- **Check**: Xcode must be 15.0 or later for SwiftData support
- **Verify**: Xcode → About Xcode
- **Fix**: Update Xcode if needed

### 3. Deployment Target Mismatch
- **Check**: Project settings must have iOS 17.0 as minimum
- **Verify**:
  - Select project → Info tab
  - Check "iOS Deployment Target" is 17.0
  - Check target "Plena" → General → Deployment Info → iOS is 17.0
- **Fix**: Set both to 17.0

### 4. SwiftData Framework Not Available
- **Check**: Device might not support SwiftData
- **Verify**: Run on a different device or simulator
- **Note**: SwiftData requires iOS 17.0+ and may have device-specific issues

### 5. Known SwiftData Bugs
- SwiftData is relatively new and may have bugs
- Some devices/configurations may have issues
- Check Apple Developer Forums for known issues

## Recommended Solution: Switch to Core Data

Since SwiftData is failing even with minimal models, I recommend switching to **Core Data**:

### Why Core Data?
- ✅ More mature and stable
- ✅ Better documented
- ✅ Works on iOS 16.0+ (broader device support)
- ✅ More examples and community support
- ✅ Proven reliability

### Migration Path
1. Create Core Data model file (.xcdatamodeld)
2. Generate NSManagedObject subclasses
3. Update storage service to use Core Data
4. Keep same data structure and relationships

## Alternative: Continue Debugging SwiftData

If you want to continue with SwiftData:
1. Try on a different device
2. Try on iOS Simulator (iOS 17.0+)
3. Check for Xcode/SwiftData updates
4. Review Apple Developer Forums for known issues
5. Consider filing a bug report with Apple

## Next Steps

**Option A: Switch to Core Data (Recommended)**
- I can create Core Data versions of all models
- More reliable and proven
- Supports iOS 16.0+

**Option B: Continue SwiftData Debugging**
- Try different devices/simulators
- Check for updates
- May be a device-specific issue
